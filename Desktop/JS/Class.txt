//Class
You can add your own methods in a class

As you can see in the example above, you call the method by referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside the parentheses).

//Class Inheritance
To create a class inheritance, use the 'extends' keyword
A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class


ES6 introduced classes.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.

Example
A simple class constructor:

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}
