What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.

ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

Why Should I Learn ES6?
React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:

Classes
Arrow Functions
Variables (let, const, var)
Array Methods like .map()
Destructuring
Modules
Ternary Operator
Spread Operator

------------------------------------------------------
1. Classes
ES6 introduced classes.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.

Example
A simple class constructor:

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}

Notice the case of the class name. We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. This is a standard naming convention for classes.

2. Arrow Functions
Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Before:
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}

With Arrow Function:
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:

hello = () => "Hello World!";

If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
